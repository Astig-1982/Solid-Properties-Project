# Solid Properties Project

Solid Properties is a website where landlords\landladies and property managers can purchase a wide array of property services. The main purpose of the website is to provide to the users a personalized shopping experience.

## How It Works

Users are encouraged to sign up and register any number of properties from their profile section, thus creating their own list of properties on the website.

### Instructions

1. Click the ```REGISTER``` tab and sign up on the website with your name and email address.
2. Go to your **Profile** page and register a property by clicking ```ADD PROPERTY```.
3. Complete the form provided with the property address, post code and number of bedrooms it comprises (please note that these are mandatory fields).
4. Go to **Services** page and choose a service.
***NOTE** that the services are differentiated between services with a fixed price and services for which the price varies (ex: **repainting**, **refurbishment**), depending on the number of bedrooms the service is purchased for*.
5. Below the service image, select from your list of properties the property for which you wish to purchase the service.
6. Based on the number of bedrooms the property selected comprises, a price will be instantly calculated. You will see displayed the **PRICE (per bedroom)** of the service, and next to it the **TOTAL COST** of the service for the property selected.
 * The shopping cart will display the price for each service for each individual property (as for many the price varies, depending on the number of bedrooms the property comprises), and also the 
total price of the service for all of the properties that has been purchased for.
 * When the purchase is complete, a detailed order history will be provided in which the users will have a history 
of each service purchased and for which of their properties has been executed.
 * If a property is no longer required on the website, go to **Profile** page and from your list of properties table click on the ```DEACTIVATE``` tab to deactivate the property from the website. This will also disable your property from your list of properties when choosing a service.
***NOTE** that in your order history will be mentioned if a property is no longer active on the website*.

Of course, if a user doesn't wish to sign up, services can be purchased without the need of registration. Upon choosing a service, if its price depends of the number of bedrooms a property comprises, 
the user can choose for how many bedrooms a service can be purchased for.

## Site Owners Goals

* A personalised shopping experience for each user, where the price of each service will be calculated for each of their individual properties.
* A website that projects a clear representation of all the services provided, so that the client won't miss any oportunity in purchasing a service that is not well represented.
* A clear explanation of what every service is providing in detail, so that the client can easily find all the info on the webiste, without the need of callling the company for additional info.
* A clear explanation of how the prices are calculated, so that the client will have a better understanding of the total upon purchasing.
* A personalised profile where the client can add her/his properties, so that she/he can have the total cost of the each service in a quick manner, without having to enter the property details all the time when selecting a service.

## Design Choices

For Solid Properties I have used a dynamic, and in the same time professional style throughout all of its sections, creating a sense of professionalism and defining a target for active people.

### Images:

#### Hero Image From Home Page:

This image represents [Tower Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_Bridge), a renowned landlmark situated next to the City - one of London's main financial districts. This, in my opinion, gives the user a sense of dynamicity, meanwhile also providing a sense of familiarity, which can facilitate in creating a bond with the company **Solid Properties**. The source of this image can be found at the [Credits](#credits) section.

#### Top Image from **Services** and **Profile** pages:

This image represents London Bridge area in London, a dynamic and cultural area that is part of London's financial district. Its proximity to Tower Bridge gives the webisite with consistency. **Saint Paul** cathedral and **BT Tower** are also in the background, which again can provide a sense of familiarity. The source of this image can be found at the [Credits](#credits) section.

#### Category Images:

These images are representatives of each category of services. They contain suggestive images that help the user to better pin point the type of services within each category. The source of these images can be found at the [Credits](#credits) section.

### Fonts:

The fonts used in this project are the following:

* [LATO](https://fonts.google.com/?query=lato) I chose this font as a **main font** because I believe it offers a clear and professional look, which matches the website purpose.
* [NATO SERIF](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Noto+Serif?preview.text_type=custom) I chose this font for **all titles** as it varies sufficent from the main font (Lato), offering a good enough contrast between them on the website's pages. In the same time, both of the styles blend in a smooth way together.

## Colors:

The colors used in this project are the following:

* **Navy Blue** - This color is used for the navbar and footer plus on some other small elements in the project (like the head elements from the cart an checkout tables). I chose this color as, in my opinion, gives a professional appereance to the site and provides a clear contrast with the rest page.
* **White** - This color is used as a main background color throughout all pages of the website. I chose to use white because I believe it is the best color on which to display information in the most clear and intelligible way. This, among others, helps the user better focus on the functionality of a service.
* **Turquoise** - This color is used mainly for the call to action buttons and for the services' icons. It provieds a good contrast with both the white used for the main background and with the navy blue used for the navbar and footer. With the latter it also goes togeher, being part of the same family of colors.

### Icons:

#### Services Icons:

I chose to use icons as the website is selling services, rather than products, which can be represented by exact images of the product itself. Also, using just general images for each service might confuse the user in the first instance. The icons used are a representation of the category to which the service belongs to. Together with the brief description of the service below, they give the user a better understanding of what the service provides.

### Extra:

#### Brief Descrition Display For Each Service:

I chosed to use this design as I believe that, as stated above, it shows in a clear way what each service provides, thus making the user experience more intuitive.

## Deployment:

Solid Property Project was developed on GitPod using git and GitHub to host the repository.

### How to run this project locally:

To run this project on your own IDE follow the instructions below:

To allow you to access all functionality on the site locally, ensure you have created free accounts with the following services:
    - [Stripe](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register)
    - [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) and [set up an S3 bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/CreatingABucket.html)

Please click the links above for documentation on how to set these up and retrieve the necessary environment variables.

### Instructions

1. Save a copy of the github repository located at [Vroom repo](https://github.com/romqrq/Vroom) by clicking the "download zip" button at the top of the page and extracting the zip file to your chosen folder. If you have Git installed on your system, you can clone the repository with the following command

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/romqrq/Vroom
    ```

2. Open your preferred IDE, open a terminal session in the unzip folder or cd to the correct location.

3. A virtual environment is recommended for the Python interpreter, I recommend using Pythons built in virtual environment. Enter the command:

    ```
    python3 -m .venv venv
    ```  

    *NOTE: The `python3` part of this command is for mac operating systems. Your command may differ, depending on the operating system you use*

4. Activate the .venv with the command:

    ```
    .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

    *Again this **command may differ depending on your operating system**. Please check the [Python Documentation on virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).*

5. If needed, Upgrade pip locally with

    ```
    pip3 install --upgrade pip.
    ```

6. Install all required modules with the command

    ```
    pip3 -r requirements.txt.
    ```

7. Set up the following environment variables within your IDE.

| Key | Value |
--- | ---
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID | `<your secret key>`
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | `<your secret key>`
DATABASE_URL | `<your postgres database url>`
DEVELOPMENT | `True`
SECRET_KEY | `<your secret key>`
STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY | `<your secret key>`
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY | `<your secret key>`
STRIPE_WH_SECRET | `<your secret key>`
  

* If using an IDE that includes a `bashrc` file, open this file and enter all the environment variables listed above using the following format:

```
HOSTNAME="<enter key here>"
```

* `HOSTNAME` should be the local address for the site when running within your own IDE.

8. If you have restarted your machine to activate your environment variables, do not forget to reactivate your virtual environment with the command used at step 4.

9. Migrate the admin panel models to create your database template with the terminal command

```
python3 manage.py migrate
```

10. Create your superuser to access the django admin panel and database with the following command, and then follow the steps to add your admin username and password:

```
python3 manage.py createsuperuser
```

11. You can now run the program locally with the following command:

```
python3 manage.py runserver
```

12. Once the program is running, go to the local link provided and add `/admin` to the end of the url.
13. Once instances of these items exist in your database your local site will run as expected.
